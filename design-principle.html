          Design principles are broad and discreet applicable regulations, standards, partialities, and design concerns.
          The foundation of design principles was founded by their cumulative knowledge and expertise in many areas –
          e.g. behavioral science, sociology, physics and ergonomics1.
        </p>
        <p>Essence of design to rule design principles are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lines, Shapes, Colors, Texture, Topography, Form, imagery, simplicity and functionality.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Design principle is important as it fulfill a website’s intended function by conveying its particular
              message whilst simultaneously engaging the visitor. Without the application of design principle there may
              exist a website but would look monotonous and unappealing.
            </li>
            <li>A well-developed website can assist to establish confidence and provide guidance to visitors. It helps
              to
              develop exceptional user experience providing better UI/UX experience.
            </li>
            <li>By following the design principle, the website could attract potential client for the business. It shows
              the positive impression about what the website is about and what values the website is supposed to
              represent.

              A well-designed website can help visitors gain confidence and provide direction. The design principle is
              significant because it allows a website to do its intended goal of conveying a message while also engaging
              the user. It conveys a pleasant image of what the website is all about and the ideals it stands for.

            <h2>Website Purpose</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            The first step into making an website is to acknowledge what the website is going to be about. The website
            should be able to accommodate the need of the user. Before designing the website, a designer has to gain as
            much practical information regarding the website3.
          </p>
          <p>For example: To know if the website is an Entertainment website, or live coverage of the sport. To get to
            know the reason on why the client want their website online. A site design isn't something designer should
            make up as you go along. A purpose will give designer a clear plan and guide the design and content
            creation.

          <p>Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. Designers
            structure visual characteristics—e.g., menu icons—so users can understand information easily. It is one of
            the most important principles behind good web design. It’s the order in which the human eye perceives what
            it sees5.

          <ul>
            <li>There are certain part of the website which are more prominent than others and are to get more attention
              than other less important parts.
            </li>
            <li>Those elements could be highlighted more by applying different texture, coloring and categorizing in
              such a way that the element represents focal point of the website.

            <p>Here is the example for the importance of focal point. In this website as the website loads the visitor
              is
              given the information of the product along with the “Buy Online” button which is presented with more
              contrast in order to attract attention hence making it a focal point of the website6.

              in
              a paragraph’s initial sentences. When the reader finds something they like, they begin reading normally,
              forming horizontal lines. The end result is something that looks like the letters F or E. As shown,
              readers
              on CNN and NY Times both use the F-Pattern to read the content.

            <p>Z-Shaped pattern is usually targeted towards general audience and website that doesn't have much text
              elements. A z-pattern design traces the route the human eye travels when they scan a page. It follows the
              shape of the letter Z, as seen from the user's perspective.
              First, people scan from the top left to the top right, forming a horizontal line, then down and to the
              left
              side of the page, creating a diagonal line, and then back across to the right again. When viewers' eyes
              move
              in this pattern, it forms an imaginary "Z" shape.

            <h2>Colors</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Using color intentionally in website design is critical. Colors evoke meaning and emotion, often at a
            subconscious level. When used strategically, color is a powerful tool for communicating a brand's message.
            For a long time brands have used color to relate their brand amongst customers. Coca Cola is branded red as
            a signature color9.
          </p>
          <p>Designers create the style of a site,  as well as the movement it makes, the emotion it creates, and its
            purpose based largely upon the color choices they make. Colors are powerful tools and an important thing all
            designers should understand when creating websites.

            <h2>Understanding color theory</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Color theory is a set of basic rules governing how harmonious color combinations are created. The first
            step to establishing efficient color palettes for companies and websites is the understanding of these
            concepts.  To pick the best colors every time, designers use a color wheel and refer to extensive collected
            knowledge about human optical ability, psychology, culture and more.

            <h2>The color wheel and Contrast</h2>
          </div>
          <p>The color wheel refers to the disc of colors that helps us determine the types of colors. The three primary
            colors are red, yellow, and blue. When combined, primary colors form secondary colors. Combining secondary
            colors with primary colors creates tertiary colors. These are combinations of primary and secondary colors
            (i.e. red-purple, yellow-orange, blue-green, etc.). </p>
          <div class="image"><img src="./assets/color-wheel.jpg" alt=""></div>
          <p>If the formation and arrangement of different colors are understood on the color wheel, it'll be easier to
            create visually appealing color palettes. An important color theory principle concerns the use of contrast.
            The higher the contrast, the more two colors stand out from one another. We would want to use colors with
            high contrast in website design because of greater legibility.</p>

            <h2>Color psychology and Brand Message</h2>

          <p>The impact of color on our mood, emotion and conduct is referred to in color psychology. People are partly
            attracted to particular colors for their feeling. Color on the reverse side can likewise trigger an
            intestinal reaction that will prevent someone from interacting with it. There needs to be an incorporation
            of color with other components on the website.</p>
          <p>Colors are used to represent different kinds of feel and emotions. For example red represents passion,
            power, love, blue represents calm, trust and competence and so on. The designer must be aware of such
            representation and check whether the color used for website matches the theme of the brand the website is
            made for.
