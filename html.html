        </div>
        <p>
          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most fundamental component
          of the Internet. It establishes the structure and meaning of web
          content. Links that connect online pages inside a single website or
          between websites are referred to as "hypertext." The text document
          within the tag that specifies the structure of web pages is defined
          using a markup language. This language is used to annotate (at the
          note for computer) text so that it may be understood by a machine
          and manipulated appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of markup languages (for example, HTML) are human
          readable. Tags are used in the language to specify what type of text
          modification is required. It's used for organizing and displaying
          material on web pages. The Internet would not exist without links.
          By publishing material to the Internet and linking it to other
          people's pages, you become an active participant in the World Wide
          Web. (developer.mozilla., 2021).

            Above is an example of an HTML boilerplate. In programming
            boilerplate refers to the co-template that can be reused.

          <p>
            HTML code is written in any text editor and phrased by any
            browser. However, in order to make the code look developer
            friendly it is written in a code editor that highlights the HTML
            keywords and making it easier for developer to write the code.
            Some common code editors include a VS Code, Sublime Text, and Atom
            and so on.

            <p>HTML 5 is a new version of HTML, the standard computer language for
              specifying the contents and look of Web pages. HTML5 was created to
              address compatibility issues with the current HTML4 standard. One of
              the most significant changes between HTML5 and prior versions of the
              standard is the requirement for proprietary plugins and APIs in older
              versions of HTML (whatis.techtarget, 2021). To make loading
              components easier, HTML5 provides a single standard interface. In
              HTML5, for example, there's no need to install a Flash plugin because
              the element runs on its own. Many elements are removed or modified
              from HTML5.</p>
            <div class="card">
              <p>HTML5 was developed to address concerns with the existing HTML4 standard. HTML5 eliminates the
                requirement for proprietary plugins and APIs that were previously required in older versions of HTML. As
                part of the standard update, many components from HTML5 are eliminated or updated.</p>

              <h2>Tags in HTML</h2>
            </div>
            <p>HTML tags are similar to keywords in that they specify how a web
              browser will structure and display material. A web browser can tell the
              difference between HTML and plain material thanks to tags. The opening
              tag, the content tag, and the closing tag are the three primary elements of
              an HTML tag. Some HTML tags, however, are not closing tags.</p>
            <p>There are commonly three types of tags in HTML. They are:</p>

            <div class="article-heading">
              <h3>Paired and unpaired tags</h3>
            </div>

            <p>When an HTML tag has an opening tag and a closing tag as its
              companion tag, it is known as a paired tag. The opening tag in an
              HTML Paired tag is the tag name contained in angle brackets.</p>
            <div class="boiler-plate"><img src="./assets/tags-html.jpg" alt="tags in html"></div>

            <div class="article-heading">
              <h3>Self-closing tags</h3>
            </div>

            <p>When an HTML tag only contains an opening tag and no closing
              tag or companion tag, it is referred to as an unpaired tag. The
              Unpaired HTML element does not require a closing tag; in this
              case, the opening tag suffices. </p>
            <div class="boiler-plate"><img src="./assets/self-closing-tag.jpg" alt="tags in html"></div>

            <div class="article-heading">
              <h3>Meta tags</h3>
            </div>

            <p>Metadata about an HTML document is defined using the Meta
              element. Metadata is data about data (information). Meta tags are
              used to provide character set, page description, keywords,
              document author, and viewport settings. They are always placed
              inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. The metadata will not be shown on the
              website, but it may be parsed by machines. Browsers (how to show content or reload page), search engines
              (keywords), and other
              online services all employ metadata
            </p>
            <p>Some example of Meta tags are:</p>
            <div class="boiler-plate"><img src="./assets/meta-tags.jpg" alt="tags in html"></div>

            <div class="article-heading">
              <h3>Link tag in HTML</h3>
            </div>
            <p>In order to link the elements such as Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) and
              JavaScript, link and Script elements are used. For Example:
            </p>
            <div class="boiler-plate"><img src="./assets/link-tag-1.jpg" alt="linking css"></div>
            <p>In order to add inline CSS, style attribute is used and to add internal css
              Style element is used.</p>
            <p>In order to add JavaScript in HTML, Script element is used. </p>

            <div class="boiler-plate"><img src="./assets/link-tag-2.jpg" alt="add JavaScript in HTML"></div>

            <p>However JavaScript is generally written in another file, so instead of
              writing it natively inside html, that JavaScript file is referenced in
              HTML. For Example:</p>
            <div class="boiler-plate"><img src="./assets/link-tag-3.jpg" alt="referring js file"></div>

          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="article-heading">
            <h2>Attributes in HTML</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Additional characteristics or properties of an element, such as the width
            and height of an image, are defined by attributes. Attributes are always
            specified in the start tag (also known as the opening tag) and are typically
            made up of name/value pairs. like <code>name="value"</code>. Attribute values should always be enclosed in
            quotation marks. Some of the commonly used
            attributes include <code> href, class, ID, placeholder</code> and so on. </p>
          <p>An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element
            and is placed inside the element's opening tag.</p>
          <p class="example"> All attributes are made up
            of two parts − a name and a value:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The name is a property that is to be set to an element. For Example
              <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> carries an attribute whose name is href. href provides the link
              to the website the text inside the element redirects. If the link is to
              be opened in the other tab there is an attribute called target where
              we can specify the value for it to perform the action.</li>
            <li>
              The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and
              always put within quotations. For example, all the CSS properties
              can be written inside the quote of style name.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>In a style sheet, the class attribute is frequently used to point to a class
            name. A JavaScript can also use it to access and manipulate elements that
            have the specified class name.</p>
          <p>While ID attribute is used for just a single element. <code>#</code> Symbol is used to
            manipulate that specific class name in CSS or JavaScript. </p>
          <p>Html Attributes played vital part in designing the website back in the
            day, with the attributes such as:</p>

          <div class="image"><img src="./assets/attribute.jpg" alt="attributes example"></div>

            <h2>Display Values in HTML</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Initially, HTML components were classified as either "block-level" or
            "inline-level" elements. Because this is a presentational feature, it is now
            described in the Flow Layout using CSS. A Block-level element takes up
            the whole horizontal space of its parent element (container) as well as the
            vertical space equivalent to the height of its contents, forming a "block."</p>

          <p>Depending on the kind of element, every HTML element has a default
            display value. Block and inline are the two display options</p>

              <div class="article-heading">
                <h3>Block-Level Element</h3>
              </div>
              <li>A new line always begins with a block level element. The whole
                available width is a block-level element (stretches out to the left
                and right as far as it can). The top and bottom margins of a block
                level element, but an inline element does not.
                One of the prominent example of the Block Level Element is
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. The element <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> commonly is utilized in other HTML

                components as a container. There are no required attributes for the
                <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, just common style, class and id. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element
                may be utilized in combination with CSS to design content blocks.</li>

                A new line does not begin with an inline element. Only the breadth
